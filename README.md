## What is FLAP?

Modern Fortran standards (2003+) have introduced support for Command Line Arguments (CLA), thus it is possible to construct nice and effective Command Line Interfaces (CLI). FLAP is a small library designed to simplify the (repetitive) construction of complicated CLI in pure Fortran (standard 2003+). FLAP has been inspired by the python module _argparse_ trying to mimic it. Once you have defined the arguments that are required by means of a user-friendly method of the CLI, FLAP will parse the CLAs for you. It is worthy of note that FLAP, as _argparse_, also automatically generates help and usage messages and issues errors when users give the program invalid arguments.

## Documentation

Besides this README file the FLAP documentation is contained into its own [wiki](https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP/wiki). Detailed documentation of the API is contained into the [GitHub Pages](http://szaghi.github.io/FLAP/index.html) that can also be created locally by means of [ford tool](https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford).

### A Taste of FLAP

A minimal *plate*:

```fortran
program minimal
type(command_line_interface) :: cli    ! Command Line Interface (CLI).
character(99)                :: string ! String value.
integer                      :: error  ! Error trapping flag.

call cli%init(description = 'minimal FLAP example')
call cli%add(switch='--string', &
             switch_ab='-s',    &
             help='a string',   &
             required=.true.,   &
             act='store',       &
             error=error)
if (error/=0) stop
call cli%get(switch='-s', val=string, error=error)
if (error/=0) stop
print '(A)', cli%progname//' has been called with the following argument:'
print '(A)', 'String = '//trim(adjustl(string))
endprogram minimal
```

That *built and run* provides:

```shell
→ ./minimal
./minimal: error: named option "--string" is required!

usage:  ./exe/test_minimal --string value [--help] [--version]

minimal FLAP example

Required switches:
   --string value, -s value
    a string

Optional switches:
   --help, -h
    Print this help message
   --version, -v
    Print version
```

A nice automatic help-message, right? Executed correctly gives.

```shell
→ ./minimal --string 'hello world'
./exe/minimal has been called with the following argument:
String = hello world
```

For more details, see the provided [tests](https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP/blob/master/src/tests).

#### Nested (sub)commands

FLAP fully supports nested (sub)commands or groups of command line arguments. For example a fake `git` toy remake can be coded as

```fortran
! initializing Command Line Interface
call cli%init(progname    = 'test_nested',                                      &
              version     = 'v2.1.5',                                           &
              authors     = 'Stefano Zaghi',                                    &
              license     = 'MIT',                                              &
              description = 'Toy program for testing FLAP with nested commands',&
              examples    = ['test_nested                      ',&
                             'test_nested -h                   ',&
                             'test_nested init                 ',&
                             'test_nested commit -m "fix bug-1"',&
                             'test_nested tag -a "v2.1.5"      '])
! set a Command Line Argument without a group to trigger authors names printing
call cli%add(switch='--authors',switch_ab='-a',help='Print authors names',required=.false.,act='store_true',def='.false.')
! set Command Line Arguments Groups, i.e. commands
call cli%add_group(group='init',description='fake init versioning')
call cli%add_group(group='commit',description='fake commit changes to current branch')
call cli%add_group(group='tag',description='fake tag current commit')
! set Command Line Arguments of commit command
call cli%add(group='commit',switch='--message',switch_ab='-m',help='Commit message',required=.false.,act='store',def='')
! set Command Line Arguments of commit command
call cli%add(group='tag',switch='--annotate',switch_ab='-a',help='Tag annotation',required=.false.,act='store',def='')
! parsing Command Line Interface
call cli%parse(error=error)
if (error/=0) then
  print '(A)', 'Error code: '//trim(str(n=error))
  stop
endif
! using Command Line Interface data to trigger program behaviour
call cli%get(switch='-a',val=authors_print,error=error) ; if (error/=0) stop
if (authors_print) then
  print '(A)','Authors: '//cli%authors
elseif (cli%run_command('init')) then
  print '(A)','init (fake) versioning'
elseif (cli%run_command('commit')) then
  call cli%get(group='commit',switch='-m',val=message,error=error) ; if (error/=0) stop
  print '(A)','commit changes to current branch with message "'//trim(message)//'"'
elseif (cli%run_command('tag')) then
  call cli%get(group='tag',switch='-a',val=message,error=error) ; if (error/=0) stop
  print '(A)','tag current branch with message "'//trim(message)//'"'
else
  print '(A)','cowardly you are doing nothing... try at least "-h" option!'
endif
```

that when invoked without arguments prompts:

```shell
cowardly you are doing nothing... try at least "-h" option!
```
and invoked with `-h` option gives:

```shell
usage: test_nested  [--authors] [--help] [--version] {init,commit,tag} ...

Toy program for testing FLAP with nested commands

Optional switches:
   --authors, -a
          default value .false.
          Print authors names
   --help, -h
          Print this help message
   --version, -v
          Print version

Commands:
  init
          fake init versioning
  commit
          fake commit changes to current branch
  tag
          fake tag current commit

For more detailed commands help try:
  test_nested init -h,--help
  test_nested commit -h,--help
  test_nested tag -h,--help

Examples:
   test_nested
   test_nested -h
   test_nested init
   test_nested commit -m "fix bug-1"
   test_nested tag -a "v2.1.5"
```

## Install

FLAP is a Fortran library composed by several modules.

> Before download and compile the library you must check the [requirements](https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP/wiki/Requirements).

To download and build the project two main ways are available:

+ exploit the [install script](#install-script) that can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP/releases/latest)
+ [manually download and build](#manually-download-and-build):
  + [download](#download)
  + [build](#build)

---

### install script

FLAP ships a bash script (downloadable from [here](https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP/releases/latest)) that is able to automatize the download and build steps. The script `install.sh` has the following usage:

```shell
→ ./install.sh
Install script of FLAP
Usage:

install.sh --help|-?
    Print this usage output and exit

install.sh --download|-d <arg> [--verbose|-v]
    Download the project

    --download|-d [arg]  Download the project, arg=git|wget to download with git or wget respectively
    --verbose|-v         Output verbose mode activation

install.sh --build|-b <arg> [--verbose|-v]
    Build the project

    --build|-b [arg]  Build the project, arg=fobis|make|cmake to build with FoBiS.py, GNU Make or CMake respectively
    --verbose|-v      Output verbose mode activation

Examples:

install.sh --download git
install.sh --build make
install.sh --download wget --build cmake
```

> The script does not cover all possibilities.

The script operation modes are 2 (*collapsible* into one-single-mode):

+ download a new fresh-clone of the latest master-release by means of:
  + [git](https://git-scm.com/);
  + [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) (also [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) is necessary);
+ build a fresh-clone project as static-linked library by means of:
  + [FoBiS.py](https://github.com/szaghi/FoBiS);
  + [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/);
  + [CMake](https://cmake.org/);

> you can mix any of the above combinations accordingly to the tools available.

Typical usages are:

```shell
# download and prepare the project by means of git and build with GNU Make
install.sh --dowload git --build make
# download and prepare the project by means of wget (curl) and build with CMake
install.sh --dowload wget --build cmake
# download and prepare the project by means of git and build with FoBiS.py
install.sh --dowload git --build fobis
```

---

### manually download and build

#### download

To download all the available releases and utilities (fobos, license, readme, etc...), it can be convenient to _clone_ whole the project:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP
cd FLAP
git submodule update --init
```

Alternatively, you can directly download a release from GitHub server, see the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP/wiki/ChangeLog).

#### build

The most easy way to compile FLAP is to use [FoBiS.py](https://github.com/szaghi/FoBiS) within the provided fobos file.

Consequently, it is strongly encouraged to install [FoBiS.py](https://github.com/szaghi/FoBiS#install).

| [Build by means of FoBiS](#build-by-means-of-fobis) | [Build by means of GNU Make](#build-by-means-of-gnu-make) | [Build by means of CMake](#build-by-means-of-cmake) |

---

#### build by means of FoBiS

FoBiS.py is a KISS tool for automatic building of modern Fortran projects. Providing very few options, FoBiS.py is able to build almost automatically complex Fortran projects with cumbersome inter-modules dependency. This removes the necessity to write complex makefile. Moreover, providing a very simple options file (in the FoBiS.py nomenclature indicated as `fobos` file) FoBiS.py can substitute the (ab)use of makefile for other project stuffs (build documentations, make project archive, etc...). FLAP is shipped with a fobos file that can build the library in both _static_ and _shared_ forms and also build the `Test_Driver` program. The provided fobos file has several building modes.

##### listing fobos building modes
Typing:
```bash
FoBiS.py build -lmodes
```
the following message should be printed:
```bash
The fobos file defines the following modes:
 - "shared-gnu"
  - "static-gnu"
  - "test-driver-gnu"
  - "shared-gnu-debug"
  - "static-gnu-debug"
  - "test-driver-gnu-debug"
  - "shared-intel"
  - "static-intel"
  - "test-driver-intel"
  - "shared-intel-debug"
  - "static-intel-debug"
  - "test-driver-intel-debug"
```
The modes should be self-explicative: `shared`, `static` and `test-driver` are the modes for building (in release, optimized form) the shared and static versions of the library and the Test Driver program, respectively. The other 3 modes are the same, but in debug form instead of release one. `-gnu` use the `GNU gfortran` compiler while `-intel` the Intel one.

##### building the library
The `shared` or `static` directories are created accordingly to the form of the library built. The compiled objects and mod files are placed inside this directory, as well as the linked library.
###### release shared library
```bash
FoBiS.py build -mode shared-gnu
```
###### release static library
```bash
FoBiS.py build -mode static-gnu
```
###### debug shared library
```bash
FoBiS.py build -mode shared-gnu-debug
```
###### debug static library
```bash
FoBiS.py build -mode static-gnu-debug
```

##### building the Test Driver program
The `Test_Driver` directory is created. The compiled objects and mod files are placed inside this directory, as well as the linked program.
###### release test driver program
```bash
FoBiS.py build -mode test-driver-gnu
```
###### debug test driver program
```bash
FoBiS.py build -mode test-driver-gnu-debug
```

##### listing fobos rules
Typing:
```bash
FoBiS.py rule -ls
```
the following message should be printed:
```bash
The fobos file defines the following rules:
  - "makedoc" Rule for building documentation from source files
       Command => rm -rf doc/html/*
       Command => ford doc/main_page.md
       Command => cp -r doc/html/publish/* doc/html/
  - "deldoc" Rule for deleting documentation
       Command => rm -rf doc/html/*
  - "maketar" Rule for making tar archive of the project
       Command => tar -czf FLAP.tar.gz *
  - "makecoverage" Rule for performing coverage analysis
       Command => FoBiS.py clean -mode test-driver-gnu
       Command => FoBiS.py build -mode test-driver-gnu -coverage
       Command => ./Test_Driver/Test_Driver
       Command => ./Test_Driver/Test_Driver -v
       Command => ./Test_Driver/Test_Driver -s 'Hello FLAP' -i 2
       Command => ./Test_Driver/Test_Driver 33.0 -s 'Hello FLAP' --integer_list 10 -3 87 -i 3 -r 64.123d0  --boolean --boolean_val .false.
  - "coverage-analysis" Rule for performing coverage analysis and saving reports in markdown
       Command => FoBiS.py clean -mode test-driver-gnu
       Command => FoBiS.py build -mode test-driver-gnu -coverage
       Command => ./Test_Driver/Test_Driver
       Command => ./Test_Driver/Test_Driver -v
       Command => ./Test_Driver/Test_Driver -s 'Hello FLAP' -i 2
       Command => ./Test_Driver/Test_Driver 33.0 -s 'Hello FLAP' --integer_list 10 -3 87 -i 3 -r 64.123d0  --boolean --boolean_val .false.
       Command => gcov -o Test_Driver/obj/ src/*
       Command => FoBiS.py rule -gcov_analyzer wiki/ Coverage-Analysis
       Command => rm -f *.gcov
```
The rules should be self-explicative.

#### build by means of GNU Make

Bad choice :-)

However, a makefile (generated by FoBiS.py...) to be used with a compatible GNU Make tool is [provided](https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP/blob/master/makefile).

It is convenient to clone the whole FLAP repository and run a *standard* make:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP
cd FLAP
make -j 1
```

This commands build all tests (executables are in `exe/` directory). To build only the library (statically linked) type:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP
cd FLAP
make -j 1 STATIC=yes
```

#### Build by means of CMake

Bad choice :-)

However, a CMake setup (kindly developed by [victorsndvg](https://github.com/victorsndvg)) is provided.

It is convenient to clone the whole FLAP repository and run a *standard* CMake configure/build commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP $YOUR_FLAP_PATH
mkdir build
cd build
cmake $YOUR_FLAP_PATH
cmake --build .
```

If you want to run the tests suite type:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP $YOUR_FLAP_PATH
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DFLAP_ENABLE_TESTS=ON $YOUR_FLAP_PATH
cmake --build .
ctest
```
